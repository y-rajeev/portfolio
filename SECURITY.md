## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not open a public issue**
2. Send an email to **mail.yrajeev@gmail.com** with the subject: `Security Vulnerability Report - Portfolio`
3. Include details about the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and potential impact

I aim to respond within 3 working days and will work with you to resolve the issue.

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
